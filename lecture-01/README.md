# Lecture-01 Python Introduction

Today we are going to see Introduction to Python.

That is knowing how Python works, why should we get used to Python, why should we work using Python, etc. okay?

So we will begin by knowing What is Python?

Python is one type of Programming language...such as C, C++, Java.

It is just like those Programming languages.

We can use it for Web development, scripting, software development, writing mathematical algorithms...it can also be used for deep learning, machine learning, data science..alright?

So Python is used in many such ways...Python makes the process easier.

Python is the most popular language in the market right now.

No other language is as demanded as Python in Pakistan & out of Pakistan.

Clear?

There are several features of Python..such as easy to code.

What does easy to code mean? Python is a Programmer, Familiar, Friendly language.

Meaning whatever coding you do in Python will be short, simple & easy.

Which means the programmer won’t need to remember any syntax, any particular following or any particular line…

won’t need to remember any particular syntax or brackets, open or close etc. you won’t need to do all of that.

Python is a free & open source language. Meaning this language can be freely downloaded and an open source means you can freely download & install it from anywhere at any time.

It is an Object Oriented Language.

Now what does Object Oriented Language mean?

It means it will give you the support of class object under which we can see how by using Python, we can work with objects (inaudible)...how can we use its concepts.

Python supports it all.

Python is a high-level programming language.

High-level means you can use any applications along with Python.

For instance, you can make GUI Applications, Web Development Applications, you can create Algorithms and many such things.

It is Platform Independent as well.

Platform Independent means you can create any code under any system and run it.

Suppose you made a code in Windows, you can run it under Linux as well.

But you got to install Python for that.

It is an Interpreted language.

But what does Interpreted language mean? It means that it will run your code line by line.

Meaning if there is any error in any particular line of your code, it will stop the execution there & then.

What happens due to this? You get to know what error is caused in what particular line and what is the cause of it.

Also, it has a rich community. Rich community means the community of this particular language.

You won’t get stuck anywhere if you get an error somewhere, you can easily find their solutions.

Infact under Python’s documentation itself, you can get all the syntaxes, all the libraries & where, what, how to use them.

You can get all of it in the rich community of Python itself.

Okay everyone?

So these are the features under Python which I hope you were able to understand easily.

I have explained each point in a very easy & simple manner.

In the next lecture, we will see how to install Python & IDE.


# 02 Installation

Hello everyone,

In the last video we saw Introduction to Python.

Meaning we got to know about Python like what is Python, what kind of language is Python.

We saw all sorts of information about Python.

Now we will see from where to download Python, how to set it up and how to set up its IDE.

So what is the first thing we have to do?

First of all, we have to Install Python.

We will download Python, install it & then use Jupyter IDE in our course.

I will also show you practically how we will install it after the installation of Python.

What we have to do is open Google Chrome.

You have to open Google.

Type Python.org which is its official website.

The website will open up.

If you are using Windows OS then you got to select Windows OS, if you are using MacOS, you’ll select that, if you are using Linux or any other platforms then you got to select that.

We are using Windows right now so I’ll select Windows.

Here, Python’s latest version which is 3.12 is available here.

What we will do is, we will click on Window Installer under 3.12 and it will start downloading it.

After the downloading finishes, click on it & click on Run.

Now the wizard for the installation of the set up is open.

One thing you must remember regarding this wizard is that you have to tick mark this “Add Python 3.9 to Path” box.

It is compulsory to tick mark this box without fail as because of this box, your environment path just like you used to set the environment path in Java, in the same way you have to set the environment path in Python.

But Python will automatically set that environment path for you.

That is why it is very necessary to click on “Add Python 3.12 to PATH”

Then click on Install Now. Your Installation process will start.

Your setup will get installed. Okay?

We will wait a bit more as the process is still On.

Set is installed. Setup was successful. Close it.

Now what do you have to do?

Go to Search. Type Run.

Type cmd. cmd will open up.

Why did we open cmd? Because we have to install Jupyter.

As I told you...install Python3. The installation is already done..

### Installation of IDE
Now we have to Install IDE. IDE is where we are going to do coding.

So to install that code, you have to use Jupyter.

Jupyter is an IDE.

What do you have to do to install an IDE?

#### Jupyter
Pip Install Jupyter.

This is its installation command.

You don’t have to go to any websites, you only have to write this command.

As you’ll click Enter, the installation process will be completed.

Later when you type Jupyter Notebook, it will open up here over the browser. Okay?

This is an IDE.

So this is how you can install the software. Alright?

You can raise topic wise queries over there.

And if you want to download any file, you can go in description and download the file.

Okay?

In the next lecture the topic we are going to see is Basic Syntax of Python where we will start the basic commands in Python.

Thank You guys.


# 03 Basic Syntax

In the last topic we saw installation & Setup, Python, IDE.

Today we are going to see how Python's Basic Syntaxes work.

Under Basic Syntaxes, I’ll first explain Basic Functions to you.

For instance, the Print function.

If you want to print any value in Python, you will use the Print function.

Suppose you took a variable & you want to print its value, then you can use the Print function.

Now I want to check the type of its variable…

How to check the type? Type function is used to check the type.

Which function? Type function.

Suppose you want input from the user, you have an input function for that.

Which function? Input function.

Now I’ll tell you how to work with basic functions.

But before that, if you want to make your Python’s code a little bit easier to read and you want to represent your coding in a neat way, you have to use comments.

What do you have to use? Comments.

#### Comments
Comments will show about the particular code you’ve written is exactly for what.

So if anyone else is working on your code, they can easily interact with your code.

The comments are represented in Python with a # hash. Okay?

There are 2 types of comments.

1st is Single Line comments. Single Line comments and Multiline comments.

These are the 2 types of comments in Python.

Now the question is, how to use them?

Let’s see with practicals…

I will show you all the basic practical functions, I’ll also show you how to apply comments.

Let’s go to Jupyter. We will make a Python file & name it Basic Syntax.

Now the first & foremost thing, how to use our Basic Functions.

To use our Basic Functions, first of all, we’ll have to use the Print function.

I have to explain that I’ve used the print function so I’ll write a comment.

The comment we write should start with # hash.

With what? # Hash.

I’ll write a comment “using print function”.

How do we use the Print function?

I’ve given Print here. You can see it turned Green.

Green denotes Python’s pre-defined function. What is it?

It is Python’s pre-defined function.

Pre-defined function is used to print your values.

You can print anything you want by using…

So let’s see how we will use the Print function..

Suppose I want to print this Hello World.

All you have to do is simply type Hello World under the Print function.

And when you click on Run, the Print function will print it here below.

So this Print function will basically be used all over in Python.

In most of the videos we are going to see ahead, the Print function will be used.

So this is how you can use the Print function.

I did string right now but even if I input integers here, such as 123..

If I run it, you can see that it printed 123 here.

Inshort, it is not necessary that it will only print strings or only integers.

We will move forward…

The next function I’ll show is Type function.

Which function? Type function. Okay?

What can you do with the Using Type function?

Basically what is Type function’s work?

It will derive your particular variable’s data type.


### Data Types

Now what is Data Type?

Data types are string, flow, double..you must have seen or heard such things, right?

But you don’t need to define anything such here in Python.

Whenever you define any variable, you don’t need to take its datatype.

However, if we want to check the variable’s data type, Python has provided us with the Type function.

Alright...how?

Suppose I have a variable named A to which I have assigned the value 10.

We’ve assigned 10 to A...what is 10? 10 is an integer value.

Now I want to check if 10 is really an Integer value or not.

How will we check it?

By using the Type function.

I will use the Type function under the Print function.

I will pass A here.

You can see that it confirmed that our variable is indeed an integer data type variable.

I’ll take another variable in the same way.

Such as B. I’ll write a string here named Python. Okay…

I wrote a string named Python.

Now I will check the datatype of the variable B.

We have the Type function to check the datatype.

I assigned B here.

It showed us here in print below that our variable is a string type variable.

Let me take another variable again…

Whom I’ll assign Float value.

We know it is float value but we want to know it is float value through Python...

How will we do it? By using the Type function.

I will pass C under Type. It showed us that it is the float value. Okay?

So this is how you can use the Type function under Python.

Now our next function is for User Input.

### User Input

If we want to take User Input...If we want to take User Input under Python,


we will use the Input function.

By using the Input function...I am not writing down the word function because it is represented by the round brackets.

So I’ve made the brackets afterwards to demonstrate the function under Python.

You can easily understand how to use the comments I’ve written as well. Right?

For instance, I want input from the user for the variable A.

I’ll use the Input function for Input and type a message to the user “Enter the value of A”

Why did I write that message? Because our user should know what value did your machine or code ask for.

Now I’ll print the value of only A.

As soon as I ran it, a text box opened up.

You can write anything...suppose I wrote Python, it printed out A’s value to be Python.

I’ll run it in the same way again.

I wrote 10 then it will print 10.

So this is how the Input function can be used here in Python.

So these were some of the basic syntaxes, basic functions which we saw today.

And when we will move forward to the next topic which is variable, I’ll explain all of these things again.

Now moving forward to see how to use Single line comments & multiline comments.

### Use of Comments
So this was a single line comment.

Suppose there is a particular program where you’ve written a very lengthy question such as “write a program to print multiple values with variable”

Now see, if you write a single hash, it will be considered as a single line comment.

What is it? A single line comment.

Now here you have 2 lines & you want to comment 2 lines.

How will you do it?

Let’s see.

What will you do? Add another hash here.

Adding 2 hashes will make it a multiline comment.

Suppose you don’t want to do this and want to use a shortcut, you can use a shortcut as well.

You simply have to select both the sentences and press Ctrl + the question mark key.

Doing that will make it multiline comments.

So you can use Multiline comments in this manner as well. Okay?

I’ll make a cell here.

I’ll mark down here that these are Multiline comments which will make it easier for you to understand when I give you the core files.

I’ll note down the shortcut as well...to apply multiline comments, use these shortcut keys.

Which is Ctrl + question mark.

I’ve written this to make it easier for you to understand.

I’ll turn it into a comment as well.

Clear?

So this is how you can use multiline comments here.

Our next topic will be Keywords in Python.

We will meet again in the next Lecture.
